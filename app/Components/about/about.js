            Our mission here at Skoolz of Fish is to not just provide top-notch aquarium services but also to teach conservation.
            We've always been enamored with wildlife and dove headfirst into the aquarist hobby. 
            We want to promote the wonders of keeping a beautiful thriving aquarium, but also teach the importance of cherishing these live specimens all around the world.
